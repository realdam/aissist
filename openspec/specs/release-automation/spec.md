# release-automation Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-automated-release-workflow. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Continuous Integration
The project SHALL provide automated continuous integration that validates code quality on every pull request and push to main.

#### Scenario: CI runs on pull request
- **WHEN** a pull request is created or updated
- **THEN** the CI workflow triggers automatically
- **AND** installs dependencies
- **AND** runs linting checks
- **AND** executes the full test suite
- **AND** validates TypeScript build succeeds
- **AND** reports pass/fail status on the PR

#### Scenario: CI runs on main push
- **WHEN** code is pushed to the main branch
- **THEN** the CI workflow runs all quality checks
- **AND** ensures main branch is always in releasable state
- **AND** blocks broken code from being merged

#### Scenario: CI failure prevents merge
- **WHEN** CI checks fail on a pull request
- **THEN** the PR shows failed status
- **AND** merge is blocked until issues are resolved
- **AND** clear error messages indicate what failed

### Requirement: Automated Version Management
The project SHALL automate version updates across all release artifacts with synchronized versioning.

#### Scenario: Version extracted from git tag
- **WHEN** a release is triggered by a version tag (e.g., v1.2.3)
- **THEN** the version number is extracted from the tag
- **AND** the tag format `v*.*.*` (semver) is validated
- **AND** invalid tags are rejected with clear error

#### Scenario: Version synchronized across files
- **WHEN** version is updated during release
- **THEN** `package.json` version field is updated
- **AND** `aissist-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version is updated
- **AND** `aissist-plugin/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plugins[0].version is updated
- **AND** all three files have identical version numbers

#### Scenario: Semantic versioning enforced
- **WHEN** creating a release tag
- **THEN** the version follows semver format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **AND** MAJOR increments for breaking changes
- **AND** MINOR increments for new features
- **AND** PATCH increments for bug fixes

### Requirement: Automated Changelog Generation
The project SHALL generate changelogs automatically from conventional commit messages.

#### Scenario: Changelog generated from commits
- **WHEN** a release is created
- **THEN** commits since the last release are analyzed
- **AND** conventional commit format is parsed (type(scope): description)
- **AND** commits are grouped by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **AND** `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with new version section

#### Scenario: Conventional commit types recognized
- **WHEN** parsing commits for changelog
- **THEN** `feat:` commits appear under "### Added"
- **AND** `fix:` commits appear under "### Fixed"
- **AND** `docs:` commits appear under "### Documentation"
- **AND** `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:` commits are optionally included
- **AND** breaking changes are highlighted prominently

#### Scenario: Changelog follows Keep a Changelog format
- **WHEN** changelog is generated
- **THEN** it follows Keep a Changelog structure
- **AND** includes version number and date
- **AND** organizes changes by category
- **AND** links to compare views on GitHub

### Requirement: Automated npm Publishing
The project SHALL publish the CLI package to npm automatically upon release.

#### Scenario: npm package published on release
- **WHEN** a release tag is pushed
- **THEN** the release workflow builds the TypeScript code
- **AND** runs the full test suite
- **AND** authenticates with npm using NPM_TOKEN secret
- **AND** publishes the package to npm registry
- **AND** package is immediately available: `npm install -g aissist@<version>`

#### Scenario: npm publish requires passing tests
- **WHEN** attempting to publish to npm
- **THEN** all tests must pass first
- **AND** build must succeed
- **AND** if tests fail, publishing is aborted
- **AND** workflow fails with clear error message

#### Scenario: npm authentication handled securely
- **WHEN** publishing to npm
- **THEN** NPM_TOKEN is read from GitHub secrets
- **AND** token is never logged or exposed
- **AND** token has publish permissions for the package
- **AND** authentication failure aborts the release

### Requirement: GitHub Release Creation
The project SHALL create GitHub releases with generated release notes for every version.

#### Scenario: GitHub release created automatically
- **WHEN** a version tag is pushed and workflow completes
- **THEN** a GitHub release is created for the tag
- **AND** release title is "Release v{version}"
- **AND** release body contains generated changelog
- **AND** release is marked as latest
- **AND** built artifacts are attached if applicable

#### Scenario: Release notes include changelog
- **WHEN** creating a GitHub release
- **THEN** the release notes contain the changelog for this version
- **AND** changes are categorized (Added, Fixed, Changed, etc.)
- **AND** includes link to full changelog file
- **AND** highlights breaking changes prominently

#### Scenario: Pre-release tags handled differently
- **WHEN** tag contains pre-release identifier (e.g., v1.0.0-beta.1)
- **THEN** GitHub release is marked as pre-release
- **AND** it doesn't update the "latest" release marker
- **AND** users must explicitly opt in to pre-releases

### Requirement: Release Workflow Orchestration
The project SHALL coordinate all release steps in proper sequence with failure handling.

#### Scenario: Release workflow sequence
- **WHEN** release workflow is triggered
- **THEN** steps execute in order:
  1. Extract version from tag
  2. Update version in all files
  3. Generate changelog
  4. Install dependencies
  5. Build artifacts
  6. Run tests
  7. Publish to npm
  8. Create GitHub release
- **AND** each step must succeed before proceeding
- **AND** failure at any step aborts the workflow

#### Scenario: Workflow failure notifications
- **WHEN** release workflow fails
- **THEN** workflow status shows as failed
- **AND** error logs are available in Actions tab
- **AND** the specific failing step is clearly identified
- **AND** maintainers are notified (via GitHub notifications)

#### Scenario: Idempotent release operations
- **WHEN** a release workflow is re-run
- **THEN** operations are idempotent where possible
- **AND** duplicate npm publishes are prevented
- **AND** GitHub release creation handles existing releases gracefully

### Requirement: Release Documentation
The project SHALL provide clear documentation for the release process and workflow usage.

#### Scenario: Release process documented
- **WHEN** maintainers need to create a release
- **THEN** documentation exists explaining:
  - How to create and push a version tag
  - What happens during the automated workflow
  - How to monitor workflow progress
  - How to verify a release succeeded
- **AND** documentation is in CONTRIBUTING.md or RELEASE.md

#### Scenario: Troubleshooting guide available
- **WHEN** a release fails
- **THEN** documentation provides troubleshooting steps
- **AND** common failure scenarios are documented
- **AND** rollback procedures are explained
- **AND** manual override steps are available if needed
