### Requirement: Complete Todos
The system SHALL allow users to mark todos as completed and log them to history automatically.

#### Scenario: Complete todo by index

- **AND** includes the linked goal if present: "Goal: goal-codename"
- **AND** adds context: "Completed from TODO"

#### Scenario: Complete todo by text match
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo done "Review PR"`
- **THEN** the system finds the first todo matching the text substring
- **AND** marks it as complete and logs to history

#### Scenario: Complete todo with goal
- **WHEN** a completed todo has a linked goal
- **THEN** the history entry includes: "Goal: goal-codename"
- **AND** the goal codename is preserved from the todo metadata

### Requirement: Remove Todos
The system SHALL allow users to remove todos without logging them to history.

#### Scenario: Remove todo by index
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo remove 2`
- **THEN** the system removes the second todo from the file
- **AND** does NOT log to history
- **AND** displays: "Todo removed: [task text]"

- **AND** updates the todo text while preserving checkbox status and goal link
- **AND** displays: "Todo updated: [new text]"

#### Scenario: Edit todo by text match
- **WHEN** the user runs `aissist todo edit "Review PR"`
- **THEN** the system finds the first matching todo
- **AND** prompts for new text
- **AND** updates the todo

### Requirement: Todo File Format
The system SHALL store todos in standard Markdown checkbox format with optional metadata.

#### Scenario: Format incomplete todo
- **WHEN** a todo is added
- **THEN** it follows the format: `## HH:MM\n\n- [ ] Todo text`
- **AND** if linked to a goal: `- [ ] Todo text (Goal: goal-codename)`

#### Scenario: Format completed todo

### Requirement: Goal Integration
The system SHALL reuse the existing goal-matcher for todo-goal linking.

#### Scenario: Keyword match for todo

- **THEN** the system extracts numbered items from the proposal
- **AND** displays them in a checkbox interface with all items selected by default
- **AND** allows user to deselect items using Space key
- **AND** creates goals only for the selected items when user confirms with Enter
- **AND** preserves goal linkage from the proposal for selected items

#### Scenario: Cancel selection

- **AND** exits gracefully

#### Scenario: No items selected
