# Tasks: Improve Branding Messaging

## Implementation Order

1. **Update main README.md branding** ✅
   - Replace opening description with "Connect your past, present, and future in Markdown" messaging
   - Add Claude Code integration as a featured benefit in the Features section
   - Reorder Quick Start to mention Claude Code integration earlier (not step 6)
   - Update introduction paragraph to emphasize temporal continuity
   - **Validation**: README reads compellingly and mentions Claude Code prominently

2. **Update package.json description** ✅
   - Change description field to include "connect your past, present, and future" language
   - Keep it concise for npm registry display
   - **Validation**: Description is under 140 characters and compelling (113 chars)

3. **Update plugin README.md** ✅
   - Update overview to emphasize seamless Claude Code integration (not just "extends")
   - Add messaging about connecting work timeline in Markdown
   - **Validation**: Plugin README aligns with main branding

4. **Update openspec/project.md Purpose** ✅
   - Update Purpose section to reflect new branding emphasis
   - Include both "connect past/present/future" and "Claude Code integration" themes
   - **Validation**: Purpose is clear and aligned with user-facing messaging

## Dependencies
- No blocking dependencies—all tasks are documentation updates
- Tasks can proceed in any order
- Task 1 (main README) is highest priority

## Parallelizable Work
- All 4 tasks can be done in parallel since they're independent documentation files
- However, starting with README.md (task 1) ensures consistency for subsequent tasks
